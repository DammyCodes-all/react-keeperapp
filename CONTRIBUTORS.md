## 🎓 Learning-Focused Guidelines

### Code Style for Education
```jsx
// ✅ Good: Educational comments
const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);
// Using useState to manage notes array state
// This creates a reactive state that triggers re-renders

// ✅ Good: Explaining complex logic
const filteredNotes = useMemo(() => {
  // useMemo prevents unnecessary recalculations
  // Only recalculates when notes or searchTerm change
  return notes.filter(note => 
    note.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );
}, [notes, searchTerm]);
```

### React Patterns to Demonstrate
- Component composition
- Props drilling and solutions
- State lifting patterns
- Custom hooks creation
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility best practices

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What We're Looking For
- **Clean, readable code** with educational comments
- **React best practices** that beginners can learn from
- **Responsive design** improvements
- **Accessibility** enhancements
- **Performance** optimizations with explanations

### What to Avoid
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Over-engineering for a learning project
- Removing educational comments
- Adding dependencies without good reason
