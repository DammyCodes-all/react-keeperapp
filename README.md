- ✅ **Modern JavaScript** - ES6+ features and best practices

## ✨ Features Implemented

| Feature | React Concept Learned | Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| 📝 **Add Notes** | State updates, form handling | `useState` for form inputs |
| 🗑️ **Delete Notes** | Event handling, state management | Click handlers with state updates |
| ✏️ **Edit Notes** | Conditional rendering | Toggle between view/edit modes |
| 🔍 **Search Notes** | Controlled components | Real-time filtering with state |
| 🌙 **Dark Mode** | Effect hooks, localStorage | `useEffect` for theme persistence |

```

## 🧠 Key React Concepts Learned

### 1. Component Composition
```jsx
// Breaking UI into reusable components
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
      <NoteSpace />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. State Management with useState
```jsx
// Managing component state
const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
```

### 3. Advanced State with useReducer
```jsx
// Complex state logic with reducer pattern
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(notesReducer, initialState);

// Dispatching actions
dispatch({ type: 'ADD_NOTE', payload: newNote });
```

### 4. Props and Data Flow
```jsx
// Passing data between components
<Note 
  key={note.id}
  note={note}
  onDelete={handleDelete}
  onEdit={handleEdit}
/>
```

### 5. Event Handling
```jsx
// Handling user interactions
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  dispatch({ type: 'ADD_NOTE', payload: noteData });
};
```

### 6. Conditional Rendering
```jsx
// Showing different UI based on state
{isEditing ? (
  <NoteEdit note={note} onSave={handleSave} />
) : (
  <NoteDisplay note={note} />
)}
```

## 🎨 Tailwind CSS Learning

### Responsive Design
```jsx
// Mobile-first responsive classes
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
```

### Dark Mode Implementation
```jsx
// Theme switching with Tailwind
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
```

### Utility-First Styling
```jsx
// Building designs with utility classes
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors">
```
